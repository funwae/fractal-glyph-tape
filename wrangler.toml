# Cloudflare Pages configuration for Fractal Glyph Tape
# This file configures deployment to Cloudflare Pages

name = "fractal-glyph-tape"
compatibility_date = "2025-11-17"

# Build output directory (relative to project root)
# Next.js static export outputs to web/out/
pages_build_output_dir = "web/out"

# Note: For Cloudflare Pages deployment via dashboard:
# - Framework preset: Next.js (Static HTML Export)
# - Build command: cd web && npm install && npm run build
# - Build output directory: web/out
# - Root directory: / (project root)

# Environment variables should be set in Cloudflare Pages dashboard:
# Settings → Environment Variables → Add variable
# Example: MEMORY_API_URL = "https://your-memory-api-url.com"

# Important: API routes in app/api/ are not supported with static export.
# These routes proxy to a Python backend that needs to be deployed separately.
