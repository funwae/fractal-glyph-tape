## Hero Section

### Headline
**Fractal Glyph Tape**
A new substrate for language: dense, fractal, cross-lingual.

### Subheadline
Turn billions of repeated sentences into a **compact, addressable phrase memory**.
Fractal Glyph Tape (FGT) clusters phrases, assigns them **glyph codes**, and lays them out on a **fractal map** that LLMs can actually use.

### Call to Action
**Primary CTA:**
> _View the interactive map_ → `/demo`

**Secondary CTA:**
> _Read the technical spec_ → `/docs`

## Section 1: What is Fractal Glyph Tape?

### Heading
**A phrase memory for the LLM era**

### Body Copy
We treat language not as a flat stream of tokens, but as a landscape of **phrase families**:

1. **Ingest multilingual corpora.**
2. **Embed and cluster** similar phrases into families.
3. **Assign each family a glyph ID** built from Mandarin characters used only as **visual glyphs**.
4. **Place these glyphs onto a triangular fractal tape**—a multi-scale address space where neighboring cells are semantically related.

From there, we let LLMs **read and write** in this inner glyph space.

### Visual Suggestion
- Pipeline diagram: Corpus → Embeddings → Clusters → Glyph IDs → Fractal Tape → Tokenizer / LLM
- Or: Animated visualization showing phrases clustering into glyphs on fractal grid

## Section 2: Why it Matters

### Three-Column Layout

#### Column 1: Semantic Compression
**Semantic compression**

- Replace repeated patterns with short glyph codes.
- Store one shared phrase-family table instead of millions of near-duplicates.
- Keep meaning; drop redundancy.

#### Column 2: Bigger-Feeling Context
**Bigger-feeling context**

- A single glyph token can stand in for an entire *motif* the model already knows.
- Under fixed token budgets, prompts carry more semantic content and longer histories.

#### Column 3: Cross-Lingual by Design
**Cross-lingual by design**

- English, Mandarin, and other languages sharing the same intent land in the same phrase family.
- Glyph IDs act as **language-agnostic anchors** for retrieval and analysis.

## Section 3: How It Works (At a Glance)

### Three-Column Layout

#### Card 1: Cluster
**Cluster**

We embed and cluster phrases into **phrase families**, keeping examples, statistics, and language labels.

#### Card 2: Glyph & Fractal
**Glyph & Fractal**

Each family gets a **glyph code** and a coordinate on a **fractal tape**—a recursive triangular map of phrase space.

#### Card 3: Integrate
**Integrate**

A **hybrid tokenizer** and **LLM adapter** let existing models consume glyph-coded text and learn to expand glyphs into natural language.

### Pipeline Diagram
```
Corpus → Embeddings → Clusters → Glyph IDs → Fractal Tape → Tokenizer / LLM
```

### Visual Suggestion
- Interactive flowchart or animated pipeline
- Each step clickable for more detail

## Section 4: Try It

### Heading
**Interactive Demo**

### Three Demo Modules

#### Demo 1: Encode Your Text
**Encode your text**

→ Paste text, see which glyphs it maps to and which phrase families activate.

**UI Element:** Text input box → Submit → Display glyph sequence + phrase family breakdown

#### Demo 2: Explore the Fractal Map
**Explore the fractal map**

→ Pan & zoom a triangular map of glyphs. Hover to see example phrases and language breakdowns.

**UI Element:** Interactive canvas with fractal grid, glyph labels, hover tooltips

#### Demo 3: Cross-Lingual View
**Cross-lingual view**

→ See how one glyph links English, Chinese, and a third language in the same family.

**UI Element:** Split-panel showing same glyph ID with examples from different languages

## Section 5: For Researchers and Builders

### Heading
**If you care about:**

### Bullet List
- Tokenization and representation learning
- Semantic compression and storage
- Cross-lingual alignment
- Long-context LLMs

…then FGT is designed to be **picked apart, extended, and argued with**.

### Three-Column Feature Grid

#### Column 1: Open Source
**Open-source Python implementation**

Full codebase available on GitHub under MIT license.

#### Column 2: Documentation
**30+ docs with specs, math, and experiment protocols**

Complete technical documentation, from vision to implementation.

#### Column 3: Experiments
**Ready-made scripts for compression, context, and retrieval experiments**

Reproducible evaluation suite for semantic compression, context extension, and cross-lingual retrieval.

## Design Notes

### Color Palette Suggestions
- **Primary:** Deep purple/indigo (represents fractal depth)
- **Secondary:** Bright cyan/teal (represents semantic connections)
- **Accent:** Warm gold (represents glyph encoding)
- **Background:** Dark charcoal or off-white (context-dependent)

### Typography
- **Headings:** Bold, geometric sans-serif (e.g., Inter, DM Sans)
- **Body:** Clean, readable sans-serif (e.g., Inter, system fonts)
- **Code/Glyphs:** Monospace (e.g., JetBrains Mono, Fira Code)
- **Mandarin glyphs:** Noto Sans CJK or similar for proper rendering

### Visual Assets Needed
1. **Hero animation:** Phrases clustering into glyphs on fractal grid
2. **Pipeline diagram:** Corpus → Embeddings → Clusters → Glyph IDs → Fractal Tape
3. **Interactive fractal map:** Pan/zoom canvas with glyph visualization
4. **Screenshot:** CLI demo showing encode/decode
5. **Comparison graphic:** Traditional tokenization vs. glyph-hybrid tokenization

### Interaction Patterns
- **Scroll-triggered animations:** Sections fade in as user scrolls
- **Hover effects:** Glyph codes light up and show phrase family preview
- **Interactive code blocks:** Users can edit and run examples
- **Responsive design:** Mobile-first, desktop-enhanced
