# Multilingual Bridge Experiments

We test FGT's cross-lingual properties.

## 1. Cross-lingual retrieval

Tasks:

- Query in language A, retrieve docs in language B.

Compare:

- Baseline embedding search.

- FGT-enhanced search using glyph IDs.

Metrics:

- Recall@k, MRR, nDCG.

## 2. Cluster language analysis

Compute:

- Language distribution per cluster.

- Language entropy.

Analyze:

- How many clusters are truly cross-lingual.

- How they support retrieval across languages.

## 3. Reporting

- Tables of retrieval metrics.

- Histograms of language entropy.
