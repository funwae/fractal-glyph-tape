# Human Evaluation Protocols

We define procedures for human judgments.

## 1. Reconstruction quality

Given:

- Original sentence.

- FGT-based reconstruction.

Raters answer:

1. Meaning preserved? (Yes / Mostly / No)

2. Fluency (1–5).

3. Acceptability for downstream use? (Yes / No).

Sample size:

- At least N=200 pairs per condition.

## 2. Cluster coherence

For a given glyph / cluster:

- Show 10 example phrases.

- Ask:

  - "How coherent is this set?" (1–5).

  - Optional: "Give a short label."

## 3. Aggregation

Report:

- Percent of reconstructions with preserved meaning.

- Average fluency.

- Average coherence.

Use these to validate that compression remains human-usable.
